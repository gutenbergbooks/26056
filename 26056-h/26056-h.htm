<p class="centern"><b><i>Transcriber&#8217;s Notes</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>About this book:</i></b> <i>A booke called the Foundacion of Rhetorike</i> was
published in 1563. Only five copies of the original are known to
exist. This e-book was transcribed from microfiche scans of the
original in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. The scans can
be viewed at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France website at
http://gallica.bnf.fr.</p>

<p><i><b>Typography:</b></i> The original line and paragraph breaks, hyphenation,
spelling, capitalization, punctuation, inconsistent use of an acute
accent over ee, the use of u for v and vice versa, and the use of i
for j and vice versa, have been preserved. All apparent <a href="#Printer_Errors">printer errors</a> have
also been preserved, and are listed at the end of this document.</p>

<p>The following alterations have been made:</p>

<p>1. Long-s (&#383;) is regularized as s.</p>

<p>2. The paragraph symbol, resembling a C in the original, is rendered
as &para;.</p>

<p>3. Missing punctuation, hyphens, and paragraph symbols have been added
in brackets, e.g. [-].</p>

<p>4. Except for the dedication, which is in modern italics, the majority
of the original book is in blackletter font, with some words in a
modern non-italic font. All modern-font passages are rendered in
italics.</p>

<p>5. Incorrect page numbers are corrected, but are included in the
list of <a href="#Printer_Errors">printer errors</a> at the end of this e-book.</p>

<p>6. Abbreviations and contractions represented as special characters in
the original have been expanded as noted in the table below.
&#8220;Supralinear&#8221; means directly over a letter; &#8220;sublinear&#8221; means directly
under a letter. The y referred to below is an Early Modern English
form of the Anglo-Saxon thorn character, representing th, but
identical in appearance to the letter y.</p>

<div class="centered">
<table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" summary="expansions">
<tr><td class="centern"><b>Original</b></td><td class="centern"><b>Expansion</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>y with supralinear e</td><td>y<span class="super">e</span> (i.e., the)</td></tr>
<tr><td>accented q with semicolon</td><td>q[ue]</td></tr>
<tr><td>w with supralinear curve</td><td>w[ith]</td></tr>
<tr><td>e with sublinear hook</td><td>[ae]</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>A macron over a vowel represents m or n, and is rendered as it appears
in the original, e.g., c&#333;preh&#275;ded = comprehended.</p>

<p><b><i>Pagination:</i></b> This book was paginated using folio numbers in a
recto-verso scheme. The front of each folio is the recto page (the
right-hand page); the back of each folio is the verso page (the
left-hand page in a book). In the original, folio numbers (beginning
after the table of contents) are printed only on the recto side of
each leaf. For the reader&#8217;s convenience, all folio pages in this
e-book, including the verso pages, have been numbered in brackets
according to the original format, with the addition of r for recto
and v for verso, e.g., Fol. x.r is Folio 10 recto, Fol. x.v is
Folio 10 verso.</p>

<p><b><i>Sources consulted:</i></b> The uneven quality of the microfiche scans, as well
as the blackletter font and some ink bleed-through and blemishes in the original,
made the scans difficult to read in some places. To ensure accuracy,
the transcriber has consulted the facsimile reprint edited by Francis
R. Johnson (Scholars&#8217; Facsimiles and Reprints, New York, 1945). The
1945 reprint was prepared primarily from the Bodleian copy, with
several pages reproduced from the copy in the Chapin Library at
Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts, where the Bodleian copy
was unclear.</p>

tifie thesame, yet I doubte not for the profite, that is in<br />
this my trauaile conteined, your honour indued with<br />

the ende of all artes and sciences, and of all noble actes<br />

Irste it is good that the learner doe vnderstand<br />
what is a fable, for in all matters of learnyng,<br />
it is the firste grounde, as Tullie doeth saie, to<br />
knowe what the thing is, that we may the bet-<br />
<span class="sidenote">What is a<br />

ter perceiue whervp&#333; we doe intreate. A fable<br />
is a forged tale, c&#333;taining in it by the colour of a lie, a matter<br />
<span class="sidenote">Morall.</span>
of truthe. The moralle is called that, out of the whiche some<br />
godlie precepte, or admonicion to vertue is giuen, to frame<br />

is, it is good to learne also, how manifolde or diuers thei be,<br />
<span class="sidenote">Three sortes<br />
of fables.<br />
i. A fable of<br />
reason.</span>
I doe finde three maner of fables to be. The first of theim is,<br />
wherein a man being a creature of God indued with reason,<br />
is onely intreated of, as the Fable of the father and his chil-<br />
dren, he willing th&#275; to concorde, and this is called <i>Rationalis<br />
fabula</i>, whiche is asmoche to saie, as a Fable of men indued<br />
<span class="sidenote">ii. Morall.</span>
with reason, or women. The second is called a morall fable,<br />
but I s&eacute;e no cause whie it is so called, but rather as the other<br />
is called a fable of reasonable creatures, so this is contrarilie<br />
named a fable of beastes, or of other thinges wanting reason<br />
or life, wanting reason as of the Ante and the Greshopper, or<br />
of this the beame caste doun, and the Frogges chosyng their<br />

man hauyng reason, and a beaste wantyng reason, or any o-<br />
ther thing wanting life, is ioyned with it, as for the example,<br />
of the fable of the woodes and the housebandman, of whom<br />

the fable of the Shepeherdes, and Wolues: how the Wol-<br />
ues on a tyme, instauntlie required of the Shepeherdes their<br />
bande dogges, and then thei would haue peace and concorde<br />
with theim, the Shepeherdes gaue ouer their Dogges, their<br />
Dogges deliuered and murdered, the shepe were immediat-<br />
ly deuoured: So saieth he, if ye shall ones deliuer to Philip,<br />
the king of the Macedonians your Oratours, by whose lear-<br />
nyng, knowlege and wisedome, the whole bodie of your do-<br />

this Fable he made an Oracion, he altered their counsailes<br />
and heddes of the Athenians, from so foolishe an enterprise.<br />
Also thesame Demosthenes, seyng the people careles, sloth-<br />

Hen Iulius Cesar had ended his mightie and huge<br />
battailes, about the flood Rhene, he marched into the<br />
regi&#333; of Fraunce: at thesame time repairing with a<br />
freshe multitude, his Legi&#333;s, but the chief cause of his warre<br />

<span class="sidenote">The cause.<br />
The fame<br />

Britaine.</span>
to see this noble Islande of Britain, whose fame for nobilit&eacute;e<br />
was knowen and bruted, not onelie in Rome, but also in the<br />
vttermoste l&#257;des. Iulius Cesar was wroth with th&#275;, because<br />
in his warre sturred in Fraunce, the fearce Britaines aided<br />
the <a href="#Printer_Errors">Fenche</a> men, and did mightilie encounter battaill with<br />
the Romaines: whose prowes and valiaunt fight, slaked the<br />

to diuerse hasardes of battaill. But Cesar as a noble warrier<br />
preferryng nobilitee, and worthinesse of fame, before money<br />
or cowardly quietnes: ceased not to enter on y<span class="super">e</span> fearce Britai-<br />

it, the fashion and maner of the people, their lawes, their or-<br />

to enter from his Shippe, on the lande, but their marchaun-<br />

the felicitee of it was so greate, whereupon the Grekes kno-<br />

He Athenians brought vnder the thraldome of<br />
the Lacedemonians, soughte meanes to growe<br />
mightie, and to pull them from the yoke, vnder<br />
the Lacedemonians. Lacedemonia was a citee<br />
enuironed with walles. Athenes at thesame<br />
tyme without walles: whereby their state was more feeble,<br />
and power weakened. Themistocles a noble Sage, and a<br />
worthie pere of Athens: gaue the Atheni&#257;s counsaile to wall<br />
their cit&eacute;e str&#333;gly, and so forthwith to be lordes and rulers by<br />
them selues, after their owne facion gouerning. In finishing<br />
this enterprise, in all poinctes, policie, and wittie conuei-<br />
aunce wanted not. The Lacedemonians harde of the pur-<br />
pose of the Athenians, &amp; sent Embassadours, to knowe their<br />
doynges, and so to hinder them. Themistocles gaue counsaill<br />
to the Athenians, to kepe in safe custodie, the Embassadours<br />
of Lacedemonia, vntill soche tyme, as he from the Embas-<br />
sage was retourned fr&#333; Lacedemonia. The Lacedemonians<br />
hearyng of the commyng of Themistocles, thought little of<br />
the walle buildyng at Athens. Themistocles was long loo-<br />
ked for of th&#275;, because Themistocles lingered in his Embas-<br />
sage, that or the matter were throughly knowen: the walle<br />
of Athens should be builded. The slowe commyng of The-<br />
mistocles, was blamed of the Lacedemonians: but Themi-<br />
stocles excused hymself, partly infirmitie of bodie, lettyng<br />
his commyng, and the expectacion of other, accompaignied<br />
with hym in this Embassage. The walle ended, necessitie<br />
not artificiall workemanship finishing it, with al hast it was<br />
ended: then Themistocles entered the Senate of Lacedemo-<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Fol. xvj.r]</a></span>nia, and saied: the walle whom ye sought to let, is builded at<br />
Athens, ye Lacedemonians, that wee maie be more strong.<br />
Then the Lacedemonians could saie nothyng to it, though<br />
thei enuied the Athenians state, the walle was builded, and<br />
leste thei should shewe violence or crueltie on Themistocles,<br />
their Embassabours were at Athens in custodie, whereby<br />
Themistocles came safe from his Embassage, and the Athe-<br />

<span class="sidenote">Howe a king[-]<br />

For, a kyngdome or common wealth, can not<br />

rulers, and magistrates, neclecting the vniuersall, and whole<br />

bothe in Philosophie, and in all other artes and sciences, that<br />
it was wounderfull. In chiualrie and in feates of warre, no<br />
p&eacute;ere was more couragious and bolde, or hardie, neither in<br />
that, whiche he enterprised, any could be of greater counsaile<br />
in hedde more pollitike, of minde more sage and wittie: his<br />
gouernement so good, that beyng so good a Magistrate, it is<br />
doubted, whether he be better man, or better Magistrate, E-<br />
paminundas died in the defence of his countr&eacute;e. The Athe-<br />
nians were enemies to the Thebanes, and many greate bat-<br />

the Athenians felt many bitter stormes, and fortune loured<br />

Though the life of manne be fraile, and sone cutte of, yet by<br />

Olon, who was a famous Philosopher, in the<br />

saieth he, who so taketh an adulterer in his beastlie facte, to<br />
kill hym. Solon beyng a wise man, was more rigorous and<br />
cruell, in this one Lawe, then he ought to be. A meruailous<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Fol. lx.r]</a></span>matter, and almoste vncredible, so wise, so noble and worthy<br />
a Lawe giuer, to bruste out with soche a cruell and bloodie<br />
lawe, that without iudgement or sentence giuen, the matter<br />
neither proued nor examined, adulterie to be death. Where-<br />
fore, reason forceth euery manne, to Iudge and ponder with<br />
<span class="sidenote">Adulterie a<br />

hymself, that either adulterie is a moste horrible vice, moste<br />
beastlie &amp; pestiferous, and not mete to tary vpon the censure,<br />

and a politike persone, but a rashe and fonde lawe giuer, that<br />
in soche a terrible voice, he should burste out, as adulterie so<br />
horrible, as not worthie to be pondered, examined and boul-<br />

thei did also obaie his other lawes. Their dominions there-<br />
by in felicit&eacute;e was gouerned: there was no populous nom-<br />

straunge worlde, a rare moderacion of that age and people.<br />
<span class="sidenote">Plato aga-<br />

Plato the godlie Philosopher, who lefte in his woorkes, and<br />
monumentes of learnyng, greate wisedome and also godlie<br />
Lawes in his bookes: intiteled vpon Lawes, and gouerne-<br />
ment of a common wealth, did not passe by in silence, to giue<br />
and ordain a Lawe against adulterie. Who also as it semed<br />
Iudged adulterie as moste horrible and detestable, in his .ix.<br />
booke <i>de Legibus</i>. This is the Lawe. <i>Adulteram deprehen-<br />
sam impune occidi a viro posse.</i> The adultrous woman saith<br />
he, taken in the crime, her housbande maie without daunger<br />
of death, or feare of punishement slea her. A straunge matter<br />
twoo so noble, so famous for wisedome, to make adulterie<br />

kyngdomes and common wealthes, vnder a colour of lawe,<br />
many a honeste persone murthered: and many a murtherer,<br />
by cloke of a Lawe, from daunger saued. In Rome somtime<br />
a Lawe there was ordained againste adulterie, whiche was<br />
called <i>Lex Iulia</i>, this Lawe Octauius Augustus set foorthe.<br />
The Lawe was thus, <i>Gladio iussit animaduerti in adulteros</i>[.]<br />
The lawe commaunded adulterers to be hedded. The chro-<br />
nicles of aunciente tymes herein doe shew, and the decr&eacute;es of<br />
auncient elders also, how horrible a thing adulterie is, when<br />
thei punishe it with death. Who knoweth not em&#333;g the Is-<br />
raelites, and in the olde lawe thei wer stoned to death. Well<br />
as Magistrates are in common wealthes remoued, or as ti-<br />
mes chaunge, lawes also are chaunged and dissolued: and as<br />
the Prouerbe is, <i>Lex vt Regio</i>, the Lawes are accordyng to<br />
the Region. Afterwarde Ualerius Publicola, a man ascen-<br />
dyng to high nobilit&eacute;e of honour, and fame emong, the Ro-<br />
maines gaue this Lawe. <i>Qua neminem licebat indicta causa<br />

a goodlie Lawe. Then afterwarde, Lawe giuers rose in the<br />
common wealth, that with more facilitee tolerated that vice,<br />
then wickednesse flowed, adulterie not punished by death.<br />
And sence that, the Romaine Empire, wrapped and snared<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Fol. lxj.r]</a></span>with soche mischiues hath decaied, in fame, nobilit&eacute;e and ver-<br />

Lawe godlie, their life beyng in vertue and godlines nurtu-<br />

lie, to perseuere and continue in godlines. The terrible sen-<br />

out the sent&#275;ce of the Magistrate and Iudge. But<br />

rashely, without consideracion of iudgement doeth procede,<br />
